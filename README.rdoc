= AllGems

== Description

AllGems is a simple project with a hefty goal: Provide easy access to documentation for all RubyGem files.

== How?

==== Backend

AllGems runs a small daemon that monitors the index of any sources registered with the locally installed RubyGems. This daemon automatically retrieves, unpacks, and generates documentation on libraries as they are released.

==== Frontend

AllGems uses a heavily modified version of Gembox to allow access to available documentation.
